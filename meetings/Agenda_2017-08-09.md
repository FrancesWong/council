## Meeting Agenda, August 9, 2017

1. **Recap - last 3 months (10 min)**
 * How do things feel in the wider group? Are people happy? Burnt out? 
 * How do you as exec feel about your workload / role / activities?
 * Any events from the last 3 months stand out as particularly good or bad?

2. **Fall plans (20 min)**
 * Send out survey - modify previous survey? (Slightly edited version [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1JQ0tjqX2ph63FczgyNmOv6a-TKdfUWvOSAuJ8DXZzCQ/edit?usp=sharing)). 
 * Send out [meeting time doodle](https://doodle.com/poll/ccqwagxzsaqbm6nf) - separate from survey? Maybe both as email footnote for a few weeks. 
     - we could consider having more than one meeting slot depending on results - perhaps a daytime coworking session once a week to accommodate people without evening availability. 
 * Advertising push! Posters! Divide and conquer with Lina taking the lead?

4. **Fall workshops (20 min)**
 * Standard SWC?
 * DHN has interest in another workshop tailored to them like the [one in May](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B6JZXa8y_013ZGVUQ2swTGxhVXc?usp=sharing).

5. **Misc (10 min)**
 * [DHN event at UTSC August 29-30](https://sites.google.com/view/utsc-dhn-event-2017/home) - they've asked us to give a short lightning talk. Anyone want to come? We could also invite someone not from exec if anyone has suggestions.
