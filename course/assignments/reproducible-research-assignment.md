## Reproducible Research Plan:

Based on the [Data Reuse Plan](https://github.com/mozillascience/working-open-workshop/blob/gh-pages/handouts/data_reuse_plan_template.md) by Mozilla WOW.  

Using the tools that were covered in previous lessons, setup a new project for your research project (the one for your final assignment). Make sure that the follow files and folders were created after setting up the project: DESCRIPTION, README.Rmd (or md), LICENSE, the .Rproj file, data/ (folder), R/ (folder), doc/ (folder).

Use the README.Rmd file to describe the data and/or software in the repository. The README.Rmd must have the following sections: Project description (with data source provided); Who we are; Installation; Usage; Folders and files in project; Citation information. More detail about what to include in each section is provided below. Not all sections will be relevant to your project.

1. Project Description: What is your project about? What is the goal? Why are you doing it? How does this data relate to your project?
    - Data Source: If you're using an external data set, provide information on where it came from. For example:
    ```
    Forstmann BU, et al. (2014) Data from: Multi-modal ultra-high resolution structural 7-Tesla MRI data repository. Dryad Digital Repository. (http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.fb41s)
    ```
2. Who We Are: Information about the people/organizations responsible for this project. For example:
    ```
    Jane Doe, University of Toronto, Dept of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology
    ```     
3. Installation and Usage Instructions for Software: General installation instructions for software you will use can go here. Re: R, necessary R packages etc.
4. File/Folder Naming and Structure: TBD
5. Citation Instructions: How can someone cite your work? Here is the place to include instructions.
