# Action Items
- Everyone read the summary below
- Martin will share his lab material via Dropbox and some specific theoretical ecology topics that he wants in the course.
- We will get back to Martin with a draft of the course
    - Schedule UofTCoders next meeting.
        - Martin only available in person for another 2 weeks.
        - Lindsay will be leaving soon also, so schedule meeting as soon as possible.
        - We should probably meet next week if we want to talk to Martin again in person before he heads out. Can also communicate via email if this is too tight.
- Asher will look into computer rooms.
- Should we clarify that regarding the 2 and 3 h blocks? Do we want the second block of the week to be 3 hours if possible? This would be because the second block is likely to be the most tutorial and project work heavy of the two weekly sessions.

# Summary
- Martin will be the course's faculty
    - Not involved in the teaching other than possibly "guest lectures" (or help recruiting for that, his grad students?).
    - Will help design the course syllabus.
    - Might contribute data sets, but we can also bring ours and discuss with him.
    - Potentially suggest papers to motivate discussion and student projects.
    - Has pre-developed material for lab classes similar to this.
- There will only be one session of the EEB430H1 Theoretical Ecology course.
    - The course description and course code is set in stone for this semester.
    - However, we will have a chance to inform students about our changes through blackboard before the course starts.
- Martin wants to reduce cleaning manipulating data part, and insert more theoretical ecology: simulation bifurcation analyses, predator prey, population dynamics, stable equilibrium analyses.
    - Will this replace some of the "openness" parts of the course?
- Asher urges us to pick assignments that are not time consuming to grade.
- There will be one 3h and one 2h block per week, hopefully both in computer room.
- They are somewhat worries around the many TAs, want there to be continuity in the group projects for sure, and probably everyone should be there for the first session also. Potentially, 3 people teaching first half, and 3 people the second half.
- For the summer, they have some money available to make lab assignments for class.
    - One of us paired with a student in EBB, to trouble and trial the assignments.
        - Would be good if we could get two of us to join for this maybe?
- Married to syllabus once it goes out. Don't be overly meticulous about non-essential aspects.
    - To be completed in august.

# Full Notes
- Probably just one session. The original version of the course will not be part of it.
- Martin has data sets
    - Fish abundance over time.
- Suggest papers motivate questions for analyses.
- Student would present the ecology part for Martin and we would help with the data analyses?
- Martin should be hands off.
- Exploring models simulation and computation that what he would want to do.
- Course description is theoretical ecology.
- Guest lectures for the critical parts of the ecology statistics, Martin's students or Martin.
- No idea of the enrollment takeup.
    - Not teach last years.
    - Teach many years ago, math only, not too popular. Very difficult.
- Make a new course code next year
- We still have the option to change the description after the enrollment, just to inform the students to be fair.
- Martin has some data set resources.
- They have idea for how to tweak it. Want to reduce cleaning manipulating data, and insert more. Simulation bifurcation analyses, stable equilibrium. More equestion based
- It will still be for loops, programming is scary etc. Teach them basic for loops.
- R over Python.
- More emphasis on mathematical models in ecology.
- Martin also has labs that he can share.
- Martin is ok with scientific publishing. in the end. Asher: How much is it about the writing vs the analyses. Think about assessment that are easy to mark 
- We will probably get the computer room;
- There will be a 3 h and a 2h block.
- The continuous mentoring of the groups.
- He think it is choppy with the lectures rotating in and out. But would still be ok with it in the end.
- Usually they have 2 instructor,  weeks each.
- Feedback they get on early assessment should be reflexive of the later assessment, can't be different instructors.
- 1 or 2 people assess everything the same week? But still keep it contiuous through the week. Important to be standardized.
- Asher seems pretty agreeable regarding the teacher TA situation.
- Martin around for two more weeks now.
- For the summer, they have some money available to make labs assignments for class.
    - One of us paired with a student in that apartment, to trouble and trial the assignments.
- Predator-prey, population stuff. Create shared dropbox.
- Married to syllabus once it goes out. Don't specify percentages if not needed.
    - To be completed in august.
- 3 +2

- Action items
1. Find out about the computer room
2. Draft slyllabus
3. Set up dropbox
4. They need to specifyu when we will be ther
