## UofT Coders Lesson Introduction

In order to welcome new and returning members to each session, and let them know some important 
information before we start our lessons, an "Intro Speaker" will go through the following 
at the start of each session (1-2min), before we do introductions.

1. Welcome everyone, and remind people what lesson this is and what UofT Coders is (a student 
group aimed building a community for sharing programming skills for research, we hold weekly 
sessions, everyone is welcome etc.)
2. We have a Code of Conduct which can be found on our website.
3. Thank MADLab for hosting us (Mobile App Development Lab, with 3D printers and VR Set)
4. Invite people to join our Gitter (https://gitter.im/UofTCoders/Lobby) to post questions/comments 
during the lesson, and remind them to sign the attendance sheet
5. If people would like to instruct or get involved, they can talk to the Intro Speaker 
or any other exec (get exec present to raise hands).
6. Lead into introductions, start with yourself and go around the room.
7. Hand off to instructor to start lesson.
