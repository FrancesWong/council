## Downloading the eStatements

- Click on the chequing account
- Either in the pop-up menu or on the side bar, there is a "View eStatements" link
- Click the link and download the eStatements for months that you don't have
- Copy the eStatement PDF to the `treasurer/estatements/` folder
- *Important:* **Do not** commit the estatements to Git! They contain sensitive 
information and should not be made public... all files in the estatement folder
are ignored by Git.

## Making an appointment

## Changing signing officers

- Fix up the `change-signing-officer.md` file with the relevant changes to names,
positions, etc
- Convert this to PDF, have the new and old signing officers sign it
- Find a time when at least two of the current signing officers and all of the new
signing officers can come to a BMO appointment
- Book an appointment using the BMO online interface (see above)
- Go to the appointment and everyone brings two identification cards (credit
card counts)
