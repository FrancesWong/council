# Steps to get reimbursed

1. Get your GitHub account [GPG verified](https://help.github.com/categories/gpg/) 
(if you need help with that, come to a session and we'll get it set up)
2. Fork the council repo and clone it to your computer, then follow these
instructions:
    - Copy `treasurer/reimbursing/template.md` to the `treasurer/reimbursing/submitted/` directory.
    - Rename the file to `YYYY-MM-DD-firstname-lastname.md`: YYYY = year, MM =
    month, DD = day (all numbers), and name = your name.
    - Replace the relevant details to the file.
    - Add and commit the file, push to your repo, and submit a pull request.
    - Copy the pull request link to the file in the appropriate location.
    - Commit and push the added change.
3. (Optional) Scan your receipts, add them to the `receipts/` directory, and
then (whenever you can). **(Required)** give the receipts to the treasurer.
4. Get your Pull Request approved by at least two other council excutives.
5. Either meet up with the treasurer to get your cheque or whenever next you see
the treasurer (or who ever has the cheque).
