# Action items
- Joel: Send Francois email with blurb
- Madeleine: Check with masters supervisor in bio stream?

# Summary
- 12 week schedule
- Need a prof to take ownership of the course, especially for pushing it through formal approval with the department.
    - The course could then be taught by grad students, but it is unheard of that this would happen already the first semester.
- Very positive to co-hosting cross-department within arts and sciences.
    - And the fact that we are from different departments already.
    - It would be more difficult to host across faculties.
- They currently have more course to teach than teaching capacity and already hire large number of stipend instructors.
    - Co-hosting could then be beneficial for them.
    - Never mentioned the increased cost of their undergrad program that EEB was afraid might be a hindrance from co-hosting with CS.
    - If CS puts in the resources, it would need to prioritize CS students.
- Potential streams of interest:
    - Scientific computing
    - Human Computer Interaction
    - Bioinformatics and computational biology (not a stream for students, but there are profs in this area)
    - Computational linguistics

# Full notes (potentially incomprehensible)
- 12 week schedule
- Need a prof to take ownership
- There is a number of gaps in curriculum, but does not necessarily mean that there will be interest.
- Big positive for co-hosting in arts and science.
    - But who will host it? Challenge
- They also have topics courses, that are seminars.
- They currently have more course to teach than teaching capacity. Curently hire alrge number of stipend instructors.
    - Dilute the expertise of pioneers in the field
    - Really need a faculty member on board to push new course.
- Grad students ok as instructors.
    - Might be trouble with the first instance of the course. To get it of the ground.
        - Could work, but have not been done before.
- He likes our differential departmental background.
- CS or more, cant say yet. Would depend on the enrollment number that are coping with... If CS puts in the resources, it needs to be prioritizes for CS students.
- Most of their intersections with other departments are in first year courses.
- It still makes sense to open it up to other students, it might just be administratively difficult.
- There is definitely areas of core CS that this could be relevant for (and completely irrelevant for others).
- They have human computer interaction, HCI, design, psychology,
- There is a comp specialist programming where about half of the program is up for grabs. Whatever area of computer science that you want. To accommodate the idea of taking CS and something else.
    - Scientific commutating
    - Human comp interaction
    - Computational linguistic potentially, they might be too advanced though....
    - Start with the two first groups...
- Cross-faculty course might be harder than just within arts and sciences across departments.
    - Potentially different reading weeks etc
    - The home would be more squarely in one faculty and almost own and distributed only by one department.
    - Could even be a multi departmental Art and Science course that other faculty can take (like MIE).
- They already have collab between comp science and biology in the bioinform and comp bio area. 
    - These people could be interested in the EEB course as well.
        - One of these were on Mad master committee.
    - Group email to Francois
- Action items
    - Draft a short blurb what were trying to what we are looking for. Find out more here
    - Francois will come back and help with other items later on if there is interest.
    - Mozilla in blurb, they have connections already
