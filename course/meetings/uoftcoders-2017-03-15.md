# Action items

## Everyone (Finish before meeting next week)
- _Most urgently_, two people edit and approve the blurb that I just pull requested before I send it off to CS https://github.com/UofTCoders/council/pull/101.
- Read through the RQM course material and consider which strategy you prefer for introducing R-coding earlier:
    1. Squish the first week into half the time.
    2. Use the tutorial time to start the R-coding sessions from week 2 in parallelled with the week 1 lectures.
- Find at least one data set that you think could be interesting for the students to work on.
    - Share links to the data and check of your progress in this issue.
    - Could add more later if we come across something, but it is good to have a solid foundation early.

## Lina
- Create a private Gitter room for the council under the current UofTCoders Gitter account.
- Merge your minutes with my pull request here https://github.com/UofTCoders/council/pull/102.

## Elliott
- Give Joel write access where appropriate.
    - Let me know what you need from me for this.

## Joel
- Email Asher course outline
- Email Christie about managing groups and data sets
- Email CS blurb

# Course Outline
We discussed the points Asher raised, and conceived of this initial outline of the course.

## 1. Scheduling
- One lecture and one tutorial of two hours each per week.
- Preferably not on two consecutive days, so that students have time to study material in between sessions.
- Afternoons and evening are preferred in general.
- Time that we are _not_ available:
    - Tuesdays 9.00-12.00
    - Wednesdays 11.30-14.00
    - Fridays 11.00-12.00.
- Office hours by appointment.

## 2. Teaching setup
- Every lecture and tutorial will have at least 2 instructors from UofT Coders.
- Each person will teach 2-3 segments, and help out on 2-3 tutorials.
- Before teaching their first segment, the instructor will be present as a helper on the previous section, so that the students are already familiar with this person as part of the class's teaching staff.
- For the tutorials, each student group will be coupled with a pair of UofT Coders instructors. One of these instructors will be present at each tutorial, so that there is continuity between which group is being helped by which instructors throughout the semester.
- We aim to divide students into 3-4 groups of 4-6 students in each group (depending on total enrollment number).
    - Student will be surveyed for their background knowledge and divided into groups so that their skills complement their groups members. 
- Together with the professor, we will provide several ecology data sets for the students to choose from.
- **Questions:**
    1. How many TA hours are this course expected to include in total?
    2. Do we have access to computers or computer labs for any or even both of the sections?
    3. Who will be the professor responsible for this course? Is it possible to meet with them as soon as possible to discuss the setup and to what degree they wish to be involved in teaching, providing data sets, etc?


## 3. Prerequisites
- We think it is more important to enforce a specific number of students enrolled in the class, rather than a certain background knowledge.
- We would like to aim for around 15 students and cap the enrollment at 20.
- If we can expect around this number of students with the current prerequisites, then we are happy to keep them as is.
- **Questions**
     1. How many students usually enrolled EBB430? Is this number expected to increase now that two sections of the course will be offered?
     2. Will this section of the course be advertised individually, or will it be presented as an option only for students who has already chosen to enroll in EEB430?


## 4. Grading
- The following areas will contribute to the final grade:
    - In class discussion participation
    - Progress reports - Short, frequent blog updates on the project. Similar to a shared lab notebook. Teaches students how to document their work and keep their colleagues up to date with their progress.
    - Reflection reports - Longer blog posts traversing topics that have been brought up in class.
    - Final science product - For example a poster, or manuscript presenting the group's results.
    - Peer review - Provide feedback on one of the scientific products from another group. 
        - Weighted component of the final science product mark, along with our marking of the product.
    - Collaborator assessment - Assess the contributions of their peers within the same group.
- Before the course drop date, students will be assessed based on discussion participation, progress reports, and reflections reports. 
- **Questions**
    1. Will there be restrictions on what percentages of students that can receive a certain grade, or can we grade them solely based on merit?
