UofT Coders Meeting Agenda
2018-09-18

## Updates & Planning
- Decide on fall schedule: meeting day + topics
- Decide on giftcards for instructors
- Data Carpentry (recent September workshop and future events this semester or next?)
- Donating to Carpentries, deal with Tax Form for Eventbrite

## Proposals
- Having exec (and others?) sign up to be the "Host" of each weekly meeting, 
meaning they must follow the set-up instructions in [this issue](https://github.com/UofTCoders/council/issues/255)
  - This will help distribute the responsibility of exec to attend meetings and confirm we always have someone there to set-up etc.
- Coding Retreat: a day or weekend for Exec to have a dedicated time to work together on some coding project (and also have fun!)
- Easier ways for new members to get more involved, make our contributing guidelines more prominent?
