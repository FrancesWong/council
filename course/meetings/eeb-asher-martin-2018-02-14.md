## Format RQM fall 2018

-   New course name: EB313 Quantitative methods for ecology in R
    -   3rd year course, still open for 4th year students (who would have priority
        enrolment)
    -   Prereqs:
        -   Currently a stats intro class and a ecology class.
        -   3rd year should have enough research experience.
        -   Not a problem with lacking computational knowledge, we teach them from
            the ground up.
-   Too many instructors for the number of students last year. The students liked
    it but it is not sustainable long term
-   They expect more students this year. The course is capped at 30, maybe will
    be 15-20?
    -   With more students, expect that some will drop, so make sure that we still
        have enough assignment points handed out before the drop deadline for them
        to know how they stand in the class.
        -   Also wait with the group work until the drop deadline has past, we don't
            want them to drop out from the groups.
    -   Typically there are around 20-25 4th year students in the research course.
        Could be a good idea to schedule for fall and advertise for these students.
        -   They could send emails about this during summer.
-   The same room for Tue and Thu would be great. To deal with less IT issues.
-   Have a formal presentation for the final project
    -   Angle as an end of semester symposium for the students (since no one took up
        the offer to submit officially this year, we will make a presentation a
        lecture component for last year).
-   More updates during the project work, have a set of questions that the student
    answer at the beginning of each class to make sure they share their struggles
    and surceases with the other groups
-   We are free to reuse any assignments we want, just take them down from the
    homepage.

## Teaching setup

-   There will probably be around 3-4 of us and 0-1 grad students from EEB.
-   We could either be TAs as last year or have a setup where 1-2 of us are course
    (co)-instructors and then 1-2 TAs.
    -   Course instructor positions have to be posted, but are usually written so that
        it is difficult for an outsider to get the position.
    -   However, Asher prefers someone with past experience to be the course
        instructor, so not Ahmed as we originally though =(
        -   Although, I think if we have two co-instructors, maybe it could be
            Ahmed together with someone from last fall.
    -   In addition to this we could always include guest lecturers from UofTCoders
        if we need more help.
    -   It is up to us how the pay will be divided, but usually TA help is not given
        to course under 25 students so can't demand too much.

## Content redesign

-   Important for next year is to make sure that the analysis techniques required
    for the group work are all covered during the class ours.
-   In the student feedback, many wished they had additional lecture time focused
    on mixed effects modelling.
-   Asher thinks it's ok to keep the diversity of data sets (and not make it only
    time series for example).
    -   They get more ownership over research question, but it does depend on the
        objective of the course.
-   A good idea could be to select 2-3 types data sets (where "type" refers to
    that they would require distinct analysis methods) with 1-2 data sets each.
    -   Make sure that each of these analyses techniques are covered during class.
-   To accommodate this deeper focus on the modelling techniques, the part that
    Madeleine taught last year will be modified.
    -   Many student appreciated learning the modelling component from the very
        basics, but also expressed some confusion for the relevance of this in
        regards to the analysis they performed during the group work.
        -   More focus on generalized linear models, mixed effect models, 
            time series, simulations, permutations, non-normal data, etc could be good
            to include here.
-   Probably we need more time for these new parts, so we might exclude the
    Git/GitHub lectures as well.
    -   The reproducible component will still be well represented through the use of
        code instead of point and click and the use of notebooks for literate
        self-documenting programming.

## Misc

-   Stats people concern: It should just not be a how to that you can read online.
    -   But having them learn how to think conceptually and quantitatively and
        connect it to a biological question. This will be the more academic
        component.
-   20h paid summer hours for course development, likely for a TA from EBB to help
    us, like last year.

## Action items

- [ ] Content redesign with focus on the analysis techniques
    -   This will include selecting new data sets, or at least deciding on what kind of analysis techniques will be used for the data sets.
- [ ] Get back to Asher with suggested teaching setup
    -   Include how payments should be divided.
- [ ] Take down the assignment from last year
- [ ] Send UofTCoders blurb to Asher for promotion
