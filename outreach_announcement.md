Hi all,

Are you interested in learning more about programming and tools for research? UofT Coders is a place for researchers and learners to get together, ask questions, share ideas and skills, and build community with others at the University of Toronto. UofT Coders meets every week on Wednesdays at 6 pm, year round. Everyone is welcome, regardless of coding experience or background.

Most UofT Coders sessions are hour-long tutorials where one person from our community leads a hands-on demonstration of a tool, package or piece of code, while everyone else follows along. We also get together for open coworking sessions to work on our own research coding and get help with questions as they arise. The tutorial sessions are led by volunteers, and the curriculum and schedule is up to us to set. 

Our next meeting will be **event title** on **date** at 6 pm in MP408 (McLennan Physical Laboratories). If you can't make it out but have ideas or questions, please post a thread on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/UofTCoders/studyGroup/issues) or check out the group [website](
https://uoftcoders.github.io/). Finally, if you'd like to stay informed about upcoming events, you can follow our [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=uoftcoders@gmail.com), sign up for our [email list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/uoftcoders), or watch our [events repository](https://github.com/UofTCoders/Events) by clicking 'Watch' at the top of our Github repo. 

Thanks!
