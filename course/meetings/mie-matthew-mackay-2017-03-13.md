# Summary
- His ideal course would be somewhat engineering specific and attractive to both mechanical and industrial engineers. He seemed more interested in uniting these two engineering streams than bridging gaps to other departments.
    - If there was a course that bridged the interests of the Mechanical and Industrial streams, that would be very attractive to the department.
- Want more programming in general for his undergrads.
    - Currently a big gap between taking a few courses in first year and then basically nothing until fourth year.
        - At least for Mechanical engineers where programming is a hard sell, the industrial stream has decent programming experience.
    - Currently mostly dependent on student electives.
- The RQM could potentially replace and update their [third year numerical methods course, MIE334](http://coursefinder.utoronto.ca/course-search/search/courseInquiry?methodToCall=start&viewId=CourseDetails-InquiryView&courseId=MIE334H1S20171).
- RQM course would be closer to industrial engineering where they do more research.
    - There is also financial engineering that could be interesting
    - Environmental engineering could be a match with EEB?
- Grad students are allowed to teach, but they mostly get professional engineers.
- Will put us in contact with some of their teaching grad students for tips.
- There might be some resistance from higher levels that tend to like the status quo.
- Suggested to contact [Bruno Korst](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/undergraduates/hardware-computer-labs/communications-lab/) in ECE - he's a lab manager with clout, might be interested in the course.

# Complete (provided as is)
- Want more programming in general for his students.
- Most relevant to engineering
- Industrial already have decent programming experience.
- APS106 interested?
- They also have second year courses in programming. Then potentially gap. Students can choose no programming or plenty of programming on the industrial side. Biggest gap in third year. Regardless of the stream they take, he thinks they should all take one programming course.
- He wants them to have minimum 3 year programming.
- Mechs are very different, avoid anything computer or electrical engineering.
    - But usually have second thoughts on this. Currently no programming from second year to 4th year fall term. Different programming in 4th year matlab etc, microcontrollers.
- He has been pushing for a core mech programming course.
- It could be more effective if shared between mech and ind, but difficult.
- Programming on the mech side hard sell, but they want to get it.
- Replace and update numerical methods course. That is more of an intro to programming course.
 RQM is closer to the IND side since they do more research already.  There is also a financial engineering that fits in.
- Mech side still has data collection and data gathering. Students might not be interested in research methods, since they don't know they need it until 3 rd year research project. Might have to make something more targeting to a specific project. Prof diller is a potential contact.
- Lots of faculty that like the status quo.
- Maybe good as IND tech elective.
- This would be a big change to their curriculum, so 18/19.
- Next year is their snapshot so no chance then.
- Grad student allowed to teach courses. P.Eng is what they try to hire for this.
    - We could find people from UofT coders who teach specifics.
    - they have already co-arrangements. Visiting prof from another department. So there would need to be a prof from ind engineering.
- Multi disciplinary courses with mech and ind very attractive overall.
- Maybe more overall with other departments and one of the streams and other departments.
- Heavy project based course could be interested for both. We can target this with the workshop
- Third year mech specialize in streams, roughly same background knowledge, but could leverage the streams. They have biomedstream. Energy and environment + EBB???
- Connect us with some people in the first year programming course.
