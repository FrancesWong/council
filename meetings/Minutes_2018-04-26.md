## Minutes / notes from election on April 26, 2018

### Ideas for the future
 * Ask people who’ve come a few times to teach a lesson – encourage them to get more involved, move them up the pathway
 * Send a debrief email after lessons to people who come: link to notes, link to livestream, instructor’s email address – pitch sign-up as a chance to get info after
 * Series of lessons – might be interest in that, especially machine learning related
 * Keep up the intro courses once a term, encourage new people to teach
 * Should we be targeting undergrads more? 

### To-do list
 * Advertising - beginning of each term
 * Properly modelling / teaching code-along format - improve contributing.md
 * Madeleine – organize day to work on projects for Data Camp, organize Software Carpentry


### Council roles
 * Ahmed – communicate with Martin and Asher, communicate with other instructors, remind about deadlines and meetings
 * Lina – implement structure for meetings, have a host to introduce UofT Coders
 * Lindsay – make pretty things: promo materials, posters, advertisements, copy for ads, Twitter account, Facebook page? Just for Software Carpentry and other special events (i.e. pub night, social events). Admin person can be the one who actually sends the emails advertising once a term
 * Important for everyone to maintain welcoming, diverse environment
