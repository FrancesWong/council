# Steps to get reimbursed

1. Get your GitHub account [GPG verified](https://help.github.com/categories/gpg/) 
(if you need help with that, come to a session and we'll get it set up)
2. Either fork the council repo or edit from the council repo (if you have
permission). Either way:
    - (via the GitHub interface) Go to the `treasurer/reimbursing/template.md`
    file, click the 'Edit file' button and rename the file to
    `submitted/YYYY-MM-DD-firstname-lastname.md` (where YYYY is the year, MM is
    the month, DD is the day, and name is your name). Commit the new file.
    - (via local file system) Copy the `template.md` file to the `submitted`
    directory, rename the file, add the details into the file, and submit a pull
    request.
3. (Optional) Scan your receipts, add them to the `receipts/` directory, and
then (whenever you can), give the receipts to the treasurer.
4. Get your Pull Request approved by at least two other council excutives.
5. Either meet up with the treasurer to get your cheque or whenever next you see
the treasurer (or who ever has the cheque).
