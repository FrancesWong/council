# Instructor On-Boarding

## First Email

Hi `Name`,

Thank you for volunteering to teach `lesson title` on `date of lesson` at `location`. We have some instructions 
and resources to help you get ready for teaching your lesson.  

1. [How to lead a lesson for UofT Coders](https://uoftcoders.github.io/studyGroup/CONTRIBUTING/#leading-a-lesson). Please
read this over at your convenience. It has some tips and tricks that we've found successful in the past. Pay 
special attention to the section called **"More on Live-Coding"** as we strictly use live-coding in our
teaching rather than conventional lectures and presentations of code. If you have any questions about this please 
let us know. 
2. To ensure our instructors are comfortable with our live-coding, we ask that all instructors do **one of the following**:
    - Attend any of our lessons (i.e. not a co-working) prior to teaching their lesson to get a sense of the format
    - OR Watch [this video of Ahmed teaching Intro to R](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b74V54VFL98) which is a great demonstration of our teaching format.
3. [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/UofTCoders/studyGroup/blob/gh-pages/codeOfConduct.md). UofT Coders has a code of 
conduct that ensures that all members that attend feel they are safe and welcome at our meetings. Please read it over 
and ensure that all lesson material abides by the code. 

Thanks again for your help. Please let us know if you have any questions prior to your lesson.

## Two Weeks Prior Reminder Email
Hi `Name`,

This is a friendly reminder that you are signed-up to teach `lesson title` on `date of lesson` with UofT Coders. Here
are some details to help the lesson go as smoothly as possible.

1. Please arrive 5 min prior to 6pm to give us time to set-up. We have an HDMI adapter for our projector, 
if you require a special adapter for your device, please let us know.
2. Please send a short blurb describing **what you will cover (bullet-points)** as well as 
**software requirements for the lesson** (e.g. installing R, Python, RStudio, special packages/libraries,
an account on GitHub etc.)
3. It is highly encouraged that you send us your material ahead of time (2 days prior) so that we can pass it along
to the attendees to follow along during the lesson. We understand if timing makes this difficult, but it really helps
the classroom learning experience.
4. Are you comfortable having your voice and screen recorded for our livestream to add to our 
[Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfGUFz6EG5gBfRt8-du0jaA?

Thanks again for your help. Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.
