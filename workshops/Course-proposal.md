This is a template for our email to course coodinators / department heads.

Points we need to cover:
* We have the curriculum set up

In follow-up:
* How many co-instructors are allowed?
* Are there requirements for grad students as teachers (i.e. third year or higher)?
* Could it be cross-listed with a grad course?

Dear ,

We are a group of graduate students interested in launching a course in reproducible computational methods. 
The curriculum is based on existing open curriculum developed by Dr. Christie Bahlai at Michigan State University.
We hope to target this course to third- or fourth-year undergraduate students in science who are interested in reproducible and quantitative research methods.
Would you be interested in talking further about the possibility of hosting this course in _____ (department)?

Best regards,
