# EEB430H1 Theoretical Ecology [24L, 12P]
Theoretical ecology uses models to explain biological phenomena such as the maintenance of biodiversity, population growth, competition, eco-evolutionary dynamics, epidemiology, spatial ecology, and species extinction. This course is designed to meet a growing demand for reproducible, openly accessible, analytically thorough, and well documented science. Students will learn to develop ecological population models, analyze data and document their research using the R programming language. No prerequisite programming experience is required.

Prerequisites: MAT 136, BIO220H1, EEB225H1, and two of EEB319H1, EEB321H1,
EEB322H1, EEB323H1

# Time and location
Tue and Thu 2-4 pm.

Tue, Ramsay Wright (RW 109)
South west corner of Harbord and St George, 1st floor, enter from St George street.

Thu, Carr Hall (SMC 325)
Corner of Queen's Park East and St. Joseph Street, 3rd floor, St. Michael's College.

## Computer labs
Students will learn theoretical ecology concepts and how to program in R. Both lecture halls have access to individual computers for the students. To use the computer workstations, students can login with their UTORid and password. Installed programs and packages are wiped from the computers daily. Saved files will be accessible from any computer via the student's login. Students can use any of the lecture halls when there are no classes scheduled. See the [online schedules](http://lab.chass.utoronto.ca/carr.php) for available times.

# Assignments / Course learning outcomes
The main goals are to:
1) integrate and apply concepts and theoretical models learnt in class,
2) learn how to collect data with real organisms (technical skills), 
3) learn how to use basic statistics to analyze and interpret data,
4) realize that data do not always fit theoretical models, but that it is important to interpret data with a larger theoretical framework in mind, 
5) learn how to work in group. 

The due dates for each lab report are listed on the lab schedule. Hand in a hard copy of your lab reports at the beginning of the lab. 

# Improving your writing skills
Effective communication is crucial in science. The University of Toronto provides services to help you improve your writing (see specific section on lab reports), from general advices on effective writing to writing centers and writing courses. See http://www.writing.utoronto.ca/. The Faculty of Arts & Science also offers an English Language Learning (ELL) program, which provides free individualized instruction in English skills. Take advantage of these!

# Academic integrity:
You should be aware of the University of Toronto Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters. Also see http://www.writing.utoronto.ca/advice/using-sources/how-not-to-plagiarize on How Not to Plagiarize. Note that it is NOT appropriate to use large sections from internet sources, and inserting a few words here and there does not make it an original piece of writing. Be careful in using internet sources – there is no review of most online material and there are MANY errors out there. Use only academic or government internet sources when absolutely necessary. Make sure you read material from many sources (published, peer-reviewed, trusted internet sources) and that you write an original text using this information. Always cite your sources. In case of doubt about plagiarism, talk to your instructor.
