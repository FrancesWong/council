This is a template for our email to course coodinators / department heads.

Points we need to cover:
* We have the curriculum set up
* I am in your department (if applicable)

In follow-up:
* How many co-instructors are allowed?
* Are there requirements for grad students as teachers (i.e. third year or higher)?
* Could it be cross-listed with a grad course?
* Course size - ideally < 20 from our end

Dear ,

We are a group of graduate students interested in launching a course in reproducible computational methods.
The curriculum is based on existing open curriculum developed by Dr. Christie Bahlai at Michigan State University to meet a growing demand for these skills in science. 
For example, many granting agencies are increasingly requiring that research results be both reproducible and publicly accessible. 
Dr. Bahlai's instructor guide can be found here: https://cbahlai.github.io/rqm-template/.

We hope to target this course to third- or fourth-year undergraduate students in science (and potentially graduate students) who are interested in reproducible and quantitative research methods. 
Would you be interested in talking further about the possibility of hosting this course in _____ (department)? 

Best regards,
