# Action Items [Issue #156](https://github.com/UofTCoders/council/issues/156)
- Check that the temperature in Ramsay Wright 109 has been fixed
- New Rstudio installed in Carr Hall? Needs to be > 1.0 for notebooks
- Did they fix NetSupport mass login support?
- Is NetSupport now available in Ramsay Wright 109?
- Did they install the packages or do we have to install every time?
- We should visit and test things out maybe a week or so before the semester starts. Especially if we want to do in class surveys.
 
# Shared info for both lecture halls
- Schedule on the door and [online](http://lab.chass.utoronto.ca/carr.php).
    - Doors are left unlocked and students are allowed to be in the lecture hall as long as it is not reserved.
- Their admin staff are located in Sidney Smith and available via phone until 17.00 every day.
- There are manuals at the podium for how most things work.
- Turn off projectors when leaving.
- Don't shut down computers, just log off.
- Usually, they only install programs, and leaves packages up to the instructors, but they will try to make an exception for us and install the packages we need for the semester.
- NetSupport is a program for interacting with all the students computers from the lecturers computer.
    - Can send our screen to the student computers, view their work, black/white list webpages and software, log in all computers via a dummy account and install R-packages.
    - Builtin survey system that pops up questions on the students' computers. However, she recommended [PollEverywhere](https://www.polleverywhere.com/) instead.
    - Currently only installed in Carr Hall, but should be added to Ramsay Wright before the fall semester.

# Ramsay Wright 109
- Enter from St George, first building on the right after crossing Harbord walking south.
- Very hot currently, talk to building management and confirm that this has been fixed before the semester starts.
- The projector remote is in the red box, on the desk in the back of the room.
    - The power on button needs to pressed several times while aiming the remote at the projector.
- There is also a VGA adapter in the red box, that can be used to connect our personal laptops to the projector.
    - Not sure if this is needed, the provided lecturer desktop computer has Rstudio installed so might be all we need.
- There is a big blackboard in this room.
- 6 rows with 4 computers on each row.
- We also have access to 107 if we need to, the rooms are connected.

# Carr Hall
- Tiny black (green) board.
- Project directly on the wall. Aspect ratio is different from the size of the projector screen.
- If we bring a laptop, connect directly to the projector instead of to dedicated slot at the podium like in Ramsay Wright.
- There is audio and a mic if we would need it.
- Rstudio was out of date here and did not have the option to create a new notebook. Assuming we will be using notebook, I asked them to update Rstudio.
- 6 rows with 5 computers per row.
