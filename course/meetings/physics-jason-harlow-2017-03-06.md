# Summary
- No openings for this fall, proposal for 18/19 would need to be submitted in fall 2017.
    - Would likely be a course led by a physics prof with TAs from UofT Coders. Some concern that TAs will not have physics knowledge.
    - He will mention the course to the physics chair, who is interested in an expansion of the computational knowledge among physics students.
- He is really interested in the material in the course and would "love to" have his undergrads take a course like this, but still not sure that the physics department is the right place to host it.
    - He thinks it could be great to share with another department, but cautions that it also brings overhead and potential conflicts regarding the future direction of the course.
    - Repeatedly referred to Allison Gibbs in the Stats department for someone who might be better suited to take this on.
    - Interested in a course more specific for physics students, "Reproducible Quantitative Methods in Biophysics" or similar.
- Good idea with a pilot in the EBB seminar course.
    - Interested in hearing the students opinions after the first semester.
    - They have few (if any) official collaborations with EBB currently.

# To consider long term
- Would this be a breath course, or part of anyone's specific program requirements?
- Could use prerequisites to limit the target audience and not have to deal with an unwieldy diversity of student background knowledge.
- Be clear about: number of students, what kind of students, and how students would be assessed.
- Consider whether our supervisors might object to spending too much time on teaching.
- Consider including 'data science' or similar in the final course name or description.
