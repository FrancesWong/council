Re: Requesting change of signing officers (Account: {{exclude for GitHub; change manually}})

Dear Bank of Montreal,

We have a change in council executives, one of which is the previous signing
officer (Luke Johnston). We would like to request a change in signing authority
to the UofTCoders Community Business Account. The former signing officers
include Luke Johnston (Treasurer), Madeleine Bonsma (President), and Lina Tran
(Admin). One current signing officer will be replaced (Luke Johnston) with the
new Treasurer (Nil Sahin). We would also like to request a position change for
Lina Tran (now President) and Madeleine Bonsma (now Special Events Coordinator).
Lastly, we would like to continue our request for 2 of 3 co-signers be required
for withdrawal purposes.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Luke Johnston, Treasurer - term ending
